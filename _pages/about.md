I am currently a Master student of Robotics at [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). Before I have obtained Bachelor's degree of Engineering in 2020 from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/).

My current research interests focus on Motion planning in unknown dynamic environment, Autonomous exploration and application of Reinforcement Learning.
